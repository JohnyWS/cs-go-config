# My CS:GO configs

This repo is my way of tracking settings in CS:GO, and I hope you can find something of use, if not least a way to structure your files, so the whole thing is a bit easier to manage.

## The details

The repo can be cloned directly into your cfg folder (default "`<steam_folder>\userdata\<user_id>\730\local\cfg\`"), but it will then auto-load all my configurations on game load. It will not, however, change your settings permanently, so your config.cfg will remain unharmed!

`autoexec.cfg` has almost no content, and you can easily replace it with your own. It calls my boot cfg which then loads all the default cfg's, with the added touch of running my credits.cfg in the end, which prints out where I collected all my input from.
